class TopTagging(Dataset):
    """
    Top tagging dataset.

    Description:
    14 TeV, hadronic tops for signal, QCD djets background, Delphes ATLAS detector card with Pythia. No MPI/pile-up included
    Particle-flow entries (produced by Delphes E-flow) have been clustered into anti-kT 0.8 jets in the pT range [550,650].
    All top jets are matched to a parton-level top within âˆ†R = 0.8, and to all top decay partons within 0.8. Also,|eta|_jet < 2 has been required.

    Ref:
    Deep-learned Top Tagging with a Lorentz Layer by A Butter, G Kasieczka, T and M Russell (arXiv: 1707.08966)

    Dataset shape:
    ~2M events have been stored divided between training (~1.6M) and test (~400k)) and the shape of the dataset is (# of events, 200, 4).
    The feature represent the leading 200 jet constituent four-momenta, with zero-padding for jets that have less than 200.
    Constituents are sorted by pT, with the highest pT one first.

    The second dataset that is included is just a flag "ttv" to identify what the event was before the reshaping operated by us. Here a legenda:
        0 = training event;
        1 = test event;
        2 = validation event;

    Note that in the current splitting of the dataset, training and validation events have been merged together as a unique training dataset. So for most intents and purposes one should just train the model on the first dataset and omit the second 'ttv' dataset altogether.

    The set label are 0 for QCD and 1 for top.

    Spinodal dataset.

    Description:
    The classification goal for this dataset is to identify the nature of the QCD phase transitic collisions at the CBM experiment and, in particular, whether signals for b-associated with the phase transition can be ound in the final momentum spectra of certain collisions.

    The task here is to classify the QCD transition nature (two different equation of state: cross-over EOSL or 1st order EOSQ) happened in heavy-ion collisions from the final state pion spectra. The pion spectra in transverse momentum and azimuthal angle are simulated here with Hybrid (Viscous Hydrodynamics plus hadronic cascade UrQMD) modeling for heavy-ion collisions by varing different physical  arameters (collision energy, entrality, initial time, initial ondition models with fluctuations, shear viscousity, freeze-out temperature, switch time from hydro to hadronic cascade)
